# Extending the Hosting Platform for Go Backends

## Purpose

This document describes how the platform can be expanded to host Go-based APIs and services. Go's lightweight concurrency model opens opportunities for efficient background tasks and high-performance APIs. Below is a high-level design and implementation plan focused on leveraging goroutines and channels.

## Goals
- Add Go as a first-class backend option alongside Python, Node.js and C#.
- Provide examples and tooling for building, containerizing and deploying Go services.
- Demonstrate concurrency patterns using goroutines and channels.

## Features

1. **Channel-Based Job Queue**
   - Implement a lightweight job queue service written in Go.
   - Workers process jobs concurrently using goroutines and a shared channel.
   - Expose HTTP endpoints to enqueue jobs and retrieve results.

2. **Event Broadcast System**
   - Add a small event bus package where subscribers receive events through channels.
   - Services can publish events, and multiple goroutines can handle them in parallel.
   - Useful for log forwarding, metrics collection or real-time notifications.

3. **Concurrent Health Checks**
   - Provide a Go utility that periodically checks service health using goroutines.
   - Results are sent through channels to a central collector for reporting to the dashboard.
   - Allows fast parallel checks across many services.

4. **gRPC Support with Streaming**
   - Document how to scaffold a gRPC server in Go.
   - Include examples of streaming RPCs using goroutines to handle client streams.
   - gRPC services can run alongside HTTP APIs and be proxied by NGINX.

5. **CLI Tool for Background Workers**
   - Build a command-line tool in Go that launches background workers for tasks like data ingestion or scheduled jobs.
   - Uses channels to coordinate tasks and a context to manage graceful shutdown.
   - Containerize the tool so it can run as part of the platform's services.

## Implementation Outline

1. **Sample Go API**
   - Create `apps/go-api/` with a minimal Go HTTP server.
   - Dockerize it using a multi-stage build: `golang:1.21-alpine` for build, then a scratch or distroless image for runtime.
   - Provide a `docker-compose.yml` exposing a configurable `PORT`.
   - Add a registry entry under `compose/app-registry/` referencing this compose file.

2. **Concurrency Examples**
   - In `services/` add Go-based utilities (job queue, event bus, etc.).
   - Each service uses goroutines and channels heavily with clear README examples.

3. **Documentation & Tutorials**
   - Document how to run `go build` and `go test` within the monorepo.
   - Provide code snippets showing idiomatic channel usage (worker pools, fan-in/fan-out, etc.).
   - Update `docs/toc.md` with a new step for Go support when implementation starts.

4. **Integration with Existing Platform**
   - The `generate-nginx.py` script already reads registry entries. Once the Go API compose file is added, it will be proxied automatically.
   - Demonstrate launching the Go service using `scripts/launch_apps.py`.

5. **Future Enhancements**
   - Expand the job queue into a distributed task system using message queues.
   - Add examples of Go services interacting with the Rust metrics exporter.
   - Consider using Go's embed package to ship static assets alongside a Go API.

## Purpose

This document outlines how we will extend the hosting platform to natively support Go backends and provide tooling that embraces Go's concurrency features. The goal is to make Go services first‑class citizens alongside the existing Python, Node.js, and C# examples.

## Proposed Features Leveraging Go Concurrency

1. **Streaming Log Aggregator**
   - Implement a Go service that tails container logs concurrently using goroutines.
   - Use channels to fan‑in log lines from multiple services and forward them to the Rust log watcher.
   - Benefit: efficient log processing with minimal overhead.

2. **Graceful Shutdown Manager**
   - Provide a small Go library or example that listens for OS signals and orchestrates shutdown across multiple goroutines.
   - Use a context with cancellation propagated via channels to stop background tasks cleanly.
   - Benefit: demonstrates idiomatic Go patterns for production readiness.

3. **Concurrent Health Check Service**
   - Build a Go microservice that periodically checks the health of registered apps in parallel.
   - Each health probe runs in its own goroutine with results sent back over channels.
   - Aggregated results can be exposed over an HTTP endpoint or pushed to the metrics exporter.

4. **Background Job Queue**
   - Offer a lightweight job queue package using buffered channels for task distribution.
   - Workers pick up jobs concurrently, enabling asynchronous workloads for Go APIs.
   - Benefit: showcase how to structure scalable pipelines with minimal dependencies.

5. **Reverse Proxy Middleware**
   - Create a Go reverse proxy example utilizing `net/http` and channels for streaming requests/responses.
   - It can serve as an alternative to NGINX for internal traffic or specialized routing scenarios.
   - Demonstrates how Go's standard library handles high concurrency without extra servers.

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Sample Go API**
   - Add an example Go backend under `apps/go-api/` with a basic HTTP server.
   - Provide Dockerfile and optional `docker-compose.yml` exposing a configurable port.
   - Document how to register the service in `compose/app-registry/`.

2. **Go Utilities Package**
   - Create a `pkg/go-tools/` directory containing reusable helpers (e.g., graceful shutdown, job queue). 
   - Include unit tests to illustrate usage of goroutines and channels.

3. **Docs and Guides**
   - Expand `docs/20-multi-language-backends.md` with a Go section referencing this file.
   - Document steps to build, test, and deploy the sample Go API.

4. **CI Integration**
   - Add Go modules to `pyproject.toml` and the CI workflow to run `go vet` and `go test` for any Go code.

5. **Future Exploration**
   - Evaluate using Go for performance-critical parts of the platform, such as a custom proxy or high-volume event processing.
   - Encourage contributions by providing a template repository demonstrating idiomatic Go practices within our orchestration stack.
