Great! Here’s a **detailed template for `04-docker-compose-orchestration.md`**, explaining how to orchestrate all your services (frontend, backend, DB, proxy) using Docker Compose.

---

```md
# 04. Docker Compose Orchestration

## Purpose

This document details how to use Docker Compose to manage and orchestrate your entire hosting platform: frontend, backend, database, and reverse proxy. Compose allows you to define, run, and update all your app services with a single command.

---

## Why Docker Compose?

- **Unified management:** Start, stop, and build all services together.
- **Networking:** All containers are connected on an isolated internal network.
- **Declarative:** Service definitions are codified in a single, readable file.
- **Scalability:** Easy to add more services or scale instances.

---

## File Structure

Your `docker-compose.yml` should be located at the project root:

```

my-hosting-platform/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── apps/
│   ├── web/
│   └── api/
├── nginx/
│   └── nginx.conf
├── services/
│   └── db/
└── ...

````

---

## Example `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  web:
    build: ./apps/web
    container_name: web
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production

  api:
    build: ./apps/api
    container_name: api
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - ENV=production

  db:
    image: postgres:16
    container_name: db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: myuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mypassword
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"  # Exposed for local dev access

  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
    depends_on:
      - web
      - api

volumes:
  db_data:
````

## Key Concepts

* **`build`**: Builds the service from the Dockerfile in the specified directory.
* **`container_name`**: Easy reference in logs and commands.
* **`ports`**: Maps internal container ports to host machine ports (`host:container`).
* **`environment`**: Passes environment variables to containers.
* **`volumes`**: Ensures data persists across restarts (used here for Postgres).
* **`depends_on`**: Ensures containers start in the right order.

---

## Typical Commands

* **Start all services (build if needed):**

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d --build
  ```

* **Stop all services:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

* **View logs for all services:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose logs -f
  ```

* **Rebuild and restart only the frontend:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d --build web
  ```

* **See container status:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose ps
  ```

---

## Adding a New App or Service

1. **Create a new folder in `/apps/` (or `/services/` as appropriate).**
2. **Add a Dockerfile if needed.**
3. **Add a new service to `docker-compose.yml`:**

   ```yaml
   newapp:
     build: ./apps/newapp
     container_name: newapp
     ports:
       - "4000:4000"
   ```
4. **Update NGINX or proxy config to route traffic if necessary.**

---

## Best Practices

* Use `env_file:` or Compose variables to keep sensitive info out of your main YAML file.
* Bind mount configs (like `nginx.conf`) for fast changes without rebuilding containers.
* Name your volumes for easy backup and migration.
* Use `docker-compose.override.yml` for local dev overrides (optional).

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Port conflicts:** Make sure only one service per host port.
* **Build failures:** Check Dockerfile paths, build context.
* **Database won’t persist data:** Ensure volume paths are correct and have write permissions.

## Next Steps

**How to use:**  
- Copy this into `docs/04-docker-compose-orchestration.md`
- Adjust service names/paths/ports as needed for your actual project.
