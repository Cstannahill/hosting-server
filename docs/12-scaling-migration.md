Here’s a comprehensive, future-focused template for **`12-scaling-migration.md`**—helping you (or contributors) move from a local Docker Compose platform to a cloud, VPS, or self-hosted PaaS when the time is right.

# 12. Scaling & Migration Planning

## Purpose

This guide provides strategies and practical steps for scaling your platform beyond a single local server, and for migrating to cloud or VPS environments, with minimal disruption.

---

## When Should You Scale or Migrate?

- **You hit hardware/resource limits:**  
  (CPU, RAM, storage, bandwidth, uptime)
- **Need for high availability or reliability:**  
  e.g., 24/7 uptime, disaster recovery, rolling updates.
- **Collaboration:**  
  Want to onboard more developers, stage/test on a real server.
- **External users or production:**  
  Opening to customers or the public.

---

## 1. Migrating to a VPS or Cloud VM

### **Recommended Steps**

1. **Pick a cloud provider:**  
   - DigitalOcean, Hetzner, Vultr, AWS Lightsail, Azure, GCP, Oracle Cloud, etc.
2. **Provision a Linux VM:**  
   - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is a great default.
3. **Install Docker and Docker Compose:**  
   - Use [Docker’s official install script](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
4. **Clone your repo to the VM:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repo>
````

5. **Copy your `.env` (with safe credentials for prod) to the server.**
6. **Set up any external volumes/data backups.**
7. **(Optional but recommended): Set up HTTPS/SSL using Let's Encrypt + NGINX.**
8. **Start your stack:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```
9. **Point your domain’s DNS to your VPS’s public IP.**

---

## 2. Preparing Your Codebase for Cloud

* **No hardcoded IPs:**
  Always use service names and environment variables.
* **No localhost assumptions:**
  Containers will communicate via internal Docker DNS.
* **Do not expose DB ports publicly:**
  Use internal-only, or restrict with firewall/security groups.
* **Use strong secrets in `.env`.**

---

## 3. Scaling Up: More Powerful Hardware

* **Resize your VM** (CPU, RAM, disk).
* **Move volumes/data:**

  * Use `docker volume` commands and backups to transfer data.
* **Run Compose on the new host.**
* **Test everything before DNS switch!**

---

## 4. Self-Hosted PaaS: CapRover, Coolify, Dokku

For a more "Vercel-like" workflow:

* **CapRover:**
  Easy UI, git-based deploys, HTTPS, one-click app setup, scaling, backups. [caprover.com](https://caprover.com/)
* **Coolify:**
  Modern, supports monorepos, FastAPI, static sites, Docker apps, UI, monitoring. [coolify.io](https://coolify.io/)
* **Dokku:**
  Lightweight Heroku-style deploys on your own VPS. [dokku.com](https://dokku.com/)

**How to migrate:**

* Deploy CapRover/Coolify/Dokku on your VPS.
* Add apps using their UI or CLI (point to your Dockerfiles or Git repo).
* Import your `.env` and volumes as needed.

---

## 5. Advanced: Kubernetes (K8s) and Managed Cloud PaaS

* **For teams or production scale.**
* Use managed Kubernetes (GKE, EKS, AKS, DigitalOcean, etc.) or services like Render, Fly.io, Railway, or Vercel.
* You’ll need to translate Compose files to Helm charts or K8s manifests.

---

## 6. Backup & Disaster Recovery

* Automate **database and volume backups** (e.g., to S3, Backblaze, etc.).
* Store backup scripts in `/services/db/` or a `/scripts/` directory.
* Test your restore process before you need it!

---

## 7. Security Checklist

* **Set strong passwords/keys** in your `.env`.
* **Use firewalls** to restrict SSH, DB, and admin interfaces.
* **Enable HTTPS** for all public-facing endpoints.
* **Keep OS, Docker, Compose, and app dependencies up to date.**

---

## 8. Migrating Logs and Monitoring

* If you’ve set up Loki/Grafana, Prometheus, etc., add those services to your cloud Compose file.
* Consider hosted logging/monitoring (Grafana Cloud, Datadog, etc.) for ease of use.

## Quick Migration Checklist

* [ ] VM or cloud server provisioned and secured
* [ ] Docker & Compose installed
* [ ] Codebase cloned to server
* [ ] Production-ready `.env` and secrets set
* [ ] Persistent volumes/data migrated
* [ ] HTTPS/SSL configured (Let’s Encrypt)
* [ ] Domains pointed to new server
* [ ] Apps tested on production stack
* [ ] Monitoring/logs operational
* [ ] Backups enabled and tested

## Congratulations!

Your stack is now ready to grow beyond your local machine—add collaborators, launch to users, or scale as needed!

**How to use:**  
- Paste into `docs/12-scaling-migration.md`.
- Add cloud/VPS provider–specific notes, backup scripts, or self-hosted PaaS deployment guides as you evolve.

**Congrats—your full, reference-quality ops docs are ready!  
Want to keep going (examples, scripts, or next topic), or need a summary doc or ToC?**
