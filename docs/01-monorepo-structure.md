Awesome! Here’s a **complete, well-structured draft** for **`01-monorepo-structure.md`**—with copy-paste-ready content and prompts for tailoring to your project.

```md
# 01. Monorepo Structure

## Purpose

This document describes the project’s folder and file structure, the rationale behind a monorepo setup, and the purpose of each major directory.  
A well-organized monorepo makes it easy to manage multiple applications (frontend, backend, etc.) and shared infrastructure as your platform grows.

---

## Why Monorepo?

- **Centralized management:** One repo for all services and infrastructure.
- **Atomic commits:** Change code, infra, or docs together in a single commit.
- **Shared dependencies:** Reuse code, configs, or assets between apps.
- **Simple orchestration:** All apps start/stop together (with Docker Compose).

## Directory/Component Breakdown

### `/apps/`
Contains all application source code.

- **/web/**  
  The main frontend application, built with Vite, React, and TypeScript.  
  Responsible for serving the user interface and static assets.

- **/api/**  
  The backend REST API, built with FastAPI (Python).  
  Handles business logic, data access, and exposes endpoints to `/api/`.

---

### `/services/`
Infrastructure add-ons and service dependencies.

- **/db/**  
  (Optional) Database migration scripts, seed data, or setup files for Postgres, Mongo, etc.

---

### `/nginx/`
Reverse proxy and routing configuration.

- **nginx.conf**  
  Main config file for NGINX. Handles HTTP requests and routes traffic to the correct app container (e.g., `/api` → backend, `/` → frontend).

---

### `/docs/`
Living documentation for this platform.  
Each major setup step has its own doc (like this one).

---

### `docker-compose.yml`
The main orchestration file for Docker Compose.  
Defines and links all services: frontend, backend, DB, NGINX, etc.

---

### `.env`
Global secrets and configuration, such as database credentials.  
**Do not commit sensitive secrets to version control.**

---

### `README.md`
High-level introduction, setup guide, and developer quickstart.

---

## Best Practices

- **Consistent naming:** Use clear, descriptive folder names.
- **Keep documentation up to date** as new apps/services are added.
- **Shared assets:** Store any shared code/libraries in a dedicated location if needed (e.g., `/packages/`).

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] [02-dockerizing-web.md](./02-dockerizing-web.md): Dockerizing the frontend (Vite) app.
- [ ] [03-dockerizing-api.md](./03-dockerizing-api.md): Dockerizing the backend (FastAPI) app.

**How to use:**

* Copy into `docs/01-monorepo-structure.md`
* Tailor folder/app descriptions if you add more services
* Add project-specific tips or diagrams if desired
