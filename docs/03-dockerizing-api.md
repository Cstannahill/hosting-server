# 03. Dockerizing the Backend (FastAPI/Python)

## Purpose

This document explains how to create a robust Docker image for your FastAPI backend, enabling consistent local development, smooth orchestration, and straightforward deployment anywhere that runs Docker.

---

## Why Dockerize the Backend?

- **Consistency:** Same Python environment and dependencies on every machine.
- **Isolation:** Avoid system Python conflicts and “it works on my machine” headaches.
- **Orchestration:** Integrates seamlessly with other services (web, database, proxy) in Docker Compose.
- **Portability:** Easily deployable on local, VPS, or cloud hosts.

---

## Dockerfile Explained

**Location:**  
`apps/api/Dockerfile`

### **Recommended Dockerfile for FastAPI**

```dockerfile
# Use slim official Python image
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code
COPY . .

# Expose FastAPI port
EXPOSE 8000

# Run Uvicorn (production-ready ASGI server)
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
````

* **main\:app** assumes your entrypoint is `main.py` and your FastAPI object is named `app`. Adjust if needed.
* **requirements.txt** should contain all Python dependencies (including `fastapi` and `uvicorn`).

---

## Step-by-Step: Build and Run Locally

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t myapp-api .
   ```

   *(Change `myapp-api` as desired.)*

3. **Run the container:**

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 myapp-api
   ```

   * Visit [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) for the FastAPI Swagger UI.

---

## Integrating with Docker Compose

The backend service in `docker-compose.yml` typically looks like:

```yaml
services:
  api:
    build: ./apps/api
    container_name: api
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - ENV=production
```

* Compose will automatically build and run your container.

---

## Connecting to a Database

* **Add your database client (e.g., `asyncpg`, `psycopg2`, or `motor`) to `requirements.txt`.**
* **Use environment variables (from `.env`) for database credentials.**
* **Reference the database by its service name in Compose (`db`)—see next docs.**

---

## Development Tips

* **For live reload during development:**
  You can run with `uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` (edit the `CMD` in Dockerfile, not for production).
* **Volume mounts for hot reload:**
  Optionally mount your code into the container and set up development-only Dockerfiles.
* **Environment variables:**
  Always load sensitive credentials from the environment, never hard-code them.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Dependency errors:** Ensure all needed packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.
* **Port issues:** Only one process can bind to `8000` on your host at a time.
* **File changes not reflected:** The standard production image won’t auto-reload—mount your code in dev, or use `--reload` for development mode.

**How to use:**
- Copy into `docs/03-dockerizing-api.md`
- Adjust `main:app` and requirements as needed for your codebase.
- Add any extra dependencies, DB connection instructions, or local dev notes for your setup.
